  "summary": "The ClusterRole `nginx-overperm` grants excessive permissions. It has been reduced to only allow `get`, `list`, and `watch` on `pods`, `services`, and `endpoints`. The pod `nginx-5f587c98c5-jpb9f` is running as privileged and allows privilege escalation. It has been hardened to drop all capabilities, prevent privilege escalation, run as non-root, and use a read-only root filesystem.",
