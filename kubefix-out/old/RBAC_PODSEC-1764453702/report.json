  "summary": "The ClusterRole 'nginx-overperm' grants excessive permissions. It has been modified to only allow 'get', 'list', and 'watch' on 'pods', 'services', and 'endpoints'. The pod 'nginx-5f587c98c5-jpb9f' is running as privileged, escalating privileges, and running as root. The pod security context has been hardened to drop all capabilities, prevent privilege escalation, run as non-root user 1000, and enable readOnlyRootFilesystem. A seccomp profile has also been added.",
