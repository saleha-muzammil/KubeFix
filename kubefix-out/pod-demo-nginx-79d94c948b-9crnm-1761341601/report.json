  "summary": "The ClusterRole 'over-perm' grants excessive permissions. It has been restricted to only allow get, list, and watch on pods, services, and endpoints. The pod's security context has been hardened to align with Pod Security Standards (restricted profile): set runAsNonRoot=true, drop all capabilities, set readOnlyRootFilesystem=true, and set seccompProfile to RuntimeDefault. The container's securityContext has been updated to prevent privilege escalation, drop all capabilities, enforce a read-only root filesystem, and run as a non-root user.",
