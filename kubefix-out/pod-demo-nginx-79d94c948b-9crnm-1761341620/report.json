It has been modified to limit access to specific resources (pods, services, endpoints, deployments, replicasets) and verbs (get, list, watch). The Pod's security context has been hardened to adhere to the restricted Pod Security Standard by setting runAsNonRoot, seccompProfile, dropping capabilities, and setting readOnlyRootFilesystem.",
